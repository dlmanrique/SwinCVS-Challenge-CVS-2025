## Overview

Welcome to the SwinCVS repository! This project presents a unified approach for classifying Critical View of Safety (CVS) structures in laparoscopic cholecystectomy using advanced deep learning techniques. Our method leverages the SwinV2 model architecture in combination with LSTM to achieve accurate and efficient classification of CVS criteria from surgical images.

## Key Features

- **SwinV2 Backbone**: Utilizes the powerful SwinV2 architecture for feature extraction.
- **LSTM Integration**: Incorporates LSTM for temporal reasoning, enhancing classification performance on sequences of images.
- **End-to-End Training**: The proposed model is designed for end-to-end training, simplifying the workflow for researchers and practitioners.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Includes evaluations against state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate effectiveness.

## Installation

Instructions for setting up the environment and installing necessary dependencies will be provided once the code is released.

## Code Release

**Note**: The code for this project will be released soon following the publication of our paper. Stay tuned for updates!
